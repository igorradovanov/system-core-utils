## OS Internals Toolkit (Python)

This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Python for use in operating system development. It serves as a toolkit for OS kernel development, providing efficient and tested implementations of arrays, queues, linked lists, and more.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute improvements, or use these implementations as a reference in your Python-based operating system projects.

## Key Features

- Well-documented implementations of essential data structures
- Tested and optimized code for use in OS kernel development
- Easily extensible for integration into your custom operating system

## Contents

- [Arrays](src/arrays.py)
- [Queues](src/queues.py)
- [Linked Lists](src/linked_lists.py)
- [...and more]

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/os-internals-toolkit-python.git
   ```

2. Integrate the desired data structures into your Python OS project.

3. Refer to individual files for documentation and usage examples.
